My current project investigates heritage language pragmatics using a novel experimental approach, where I am advised by Savithry Namboodiripad and Ezra Keshet. More broadly, I am interested in experimental semantics and pragmatics, multilingualism, psycholinguistics, and language contact.\nYou can reach me via email: jhark [at] umich [dot] edu"
