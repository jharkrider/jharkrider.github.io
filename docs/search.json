My senior honors thesis “An Experimental Approach to Modal Particles in the Recent German Diaspora” implemented a novel experimental approach to measuring how language experience affects the expression of modality in an early-learned but non-dominant language.\nTo learn more about my ongoing projects, check out my research page.
