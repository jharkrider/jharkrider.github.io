I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor studying Linguistics and German. My current project investigates heritage language pragmatics using a novel experimental approach, where I am advised by Savithry Namboodiripad and Ezra Keshet. \

More broadly, I am interested in experimental semantics and pragmatics, multilingualism, psycholinguistics, and language contact.
