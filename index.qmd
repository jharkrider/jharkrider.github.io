I am a recent graduate of the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, where I studied Linguistics and German. My senior honors thesis "An Experimental Approach to Modal Particles in the Recent German Diaspora" implemented a novel experimental approach to measuring how language experience affects the expression of modality in an early-learned but non-dominant language. 

I am interested in experimental semantics and pragmatics, multilingualism, psycholinguistics, and language contact/change.
